`pymatch_ds`
=====

This package was forked from the original [PyMatch Package](https://github.com/benmiroglio/pymatch). The package is meant to be a matching algorithm for studies. The original intention is clinical trials, but can forked and used for any matching necessary. The original PyMatch package had homogeneous dependent variables; this variation takes care of that in case there is data with heterogeneous dependent variables.


# Installation

Install through pip!

```bash
$ pip install pymatch
```
or install through anaconda

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/netllakula/pymatch_ds
```
# 

The best way to get familiar with the package is to work through an example. An example is provided as a Jupyter Notebook: Example.ipynb.
